# House Buzzer System

Welcome to the House Buzzer System README! 🏠🔔


1. **Changing the background image**: Different images can be chosen by pressing keys 'v', 'l', 'b', or 'a'. Each key press changes the background image of a square defined on the webpage. For instance, 'v' links to an image for option "Vir", 'l' for "Leo", 'b' for "Bovis", and 'a' for "Aquila". The images are then set as the background for the div element with the id `square`. Once a background image is set, no other images can replace it until the system is reset.
2. **Switching between dark and light modes**: Two icons at the bottom of the page (represented by the moon and sun icons) allow the user to toggle between light and dark modes.
